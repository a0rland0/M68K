# M68K

M68K assembler and disassembler tool  
Some stuff can be tweaked with the definitions that are available in m68k.h  

// use this macro to optimize the structures in terms of space (might generate slower code)  
//#define M68K_OPTIMIZE_SPACE  

// use this macro to compile the code assuming that the target machine is big-endian  
//#define M68K_TARGET_IS_BIG_ENDIAN  

Enjoy
